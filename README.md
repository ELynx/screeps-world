# TODO
Cached "creep with energy" search in controller.template.
"Hot" areas to avoid for worker creeps.
Order creeps with energy by mobility, assign accordingly.
Creep keeps room ID for spawn calculations.
Level based on current capacity, not controller level. Or creeps die out because there are no extensions.

# Ideas
Withdraw from enemy structures
Dismantle enemy structures
Use getActiveBodyparts
Use Room.lookAtArea
